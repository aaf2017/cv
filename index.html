    I am a pianist working primarily with classical singers. I love coaching and performing. I also have a real estate license in the state of Florida. My hobbies are visual arts, hot yoga, reading, and cooking....eh...well, when I am
    inspired ðŸ˜‰. I live in Miami with my husband, our daughter, and two adorable dogs. Our family LOVES PETS!

    During Covid-19 pandemic in 2020 I lost all my professional engagements, and most of my sources of income. Since I always loved studying, and enjoyed obtaining new skills and attaining new goals, the decision to learn coding and web design came
    naturally. Currently, I am well into the process, and cannot wait to see what the future career will bring. I AM SO EXCITED!
